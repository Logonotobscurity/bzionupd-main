## After Setting Variables: Verification

Once variables are set and deployment completes, verify:

✅ **Homepage:** https://bzionshopfmcg.netlify.app
✅ **Login Page:** https://bzionshopfmcg.netlify.app/login
✅ **Admin Dashboard:** https://bzionshopfmcg.netlify.app/admin (if admin user)
✅ **Authentication:** Try creating account and logging in
✅ **Email:** Verify emails are being sent
✅ **Console:** Check browser console for errors

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Build Fails with "NEXTAUTH_URL not set"**
→ Make sure `NEXTAUTH_URL` is in Netlify UI (not just .env.production)

**Login Shows "Configuration Error"**
→ Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches deployment URL exactly

**Database Connection Error**
→ Check DATABASE_URL in Netlify UI (should be identical to local .env)

**Email Not Sending**
→ Verify Resend credentials in Netlify UI

**"Can't reach database server"**
→ Check DATABASE_URL is accessible from Netlify region

For more details, see **NETLIFY_ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md** → Troubleshooting section

## File Changes

**New Files Created:**
- `.env.local.example` - Local development template
- `NETLIFY_ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup instructions
- `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre/post deployment verification

**Modified Files:**
- `.env.production` - Already configured

## What's Happening Behind the Scenes

When you trigger a deployment:

1. **Netlify watches GitHub** - Automatically deploys on push to `main`
2. **Build command runs:** `npm run build`
   - Prisma generates client
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Next.js builds application
   - Output goes to `.next` directory
3. **Environment variables applied** from Netlify UI
4. **Site deployed** to: https://bzionshopfmcg.netlify.app
5. **Auto-HTTPS** - SSL certificate automatic

## Next Actions

### ✅ REQUIRED (Today)
1. Set all environment variables in Netlify UI
2. Trigger deployment
3. Verify site loads at https://bzionshopfmcg.netlify.app
